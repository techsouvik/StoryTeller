This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Add a .env file in the root directory of the project with the following contents.

```bash
AUTH_GITHUB_ID =
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET = 
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY = 
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN =
LICA_API = 

```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
